I have an error when using a function, what can I do?
*****************************************************

If you encounter an unexpected error (coming from the source code), we recommend to first check if you are using the latest version of STATINF

.. code::

    pip3 show statinf

If the version is not the latest one, please upgrade it.

.. code::

    pip3 install --upgrade statinf

If you still encounter the same error with the most recent version, please raise an `issue`_
